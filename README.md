# Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)... in VS Code

This extension displays your `kind` local cluster in the Kubernetes extension's Cloud Explorer.
You can use this to create and delete clusters, and to merge them into your kubeconfig.

**This is an early stage preview. It's not feature complete! Feature requests welcome via the issues page.
(And let us know about bugs too!)**

# Prerequisites

You must have the `kind` binary on your system path.  You can download the binaries for your operating system
from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases.

This version of the extension has been tested only with Kind 0.4.0 (and only on Windows so far, though it
should work on other OSes).
